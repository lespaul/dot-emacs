Multiple Workspace Guide
========================

Running eclim against more than one eclipse workspace can be accomplished by
running multiple eclimd instances.  To accomplish this you must configure each
instance to run nailgun on a unique port and supply the path to the workspace
you which that instance to use.  Once your eclimd instances are up and running
the vim client will automatically determine which server to send requests to
based on your context.  In some cases you may be prompted for which workspace
to use if one cannot be determined for you.

Below are some different ways in which you can configure your eclimd instances:

1. All Users: Supply the nailgun port and eclipse workspace path when starting
   eclimd:

  ::

    $ eclimd -Dosgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/workspace1 -Dnailgun.server.port=9091
    $ eclimd -Dosgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/workspace2 -Dnailgun.server.port=9092

  If you are using the eclimd view in the eclipse gui, then you can start the
  eclipse gui with the desired nailgun server port (note that you must place
  the -vmargs option before the list of jvm arguments):

  ::

    $ eclipse -vmargs -Dnailgun.server.port=9092

2. Linux, OSX, BSD Users: Specify the port and workspace in eclimrc files and
   start eclimd with the -f argument:

  ::

    $ vim ~/.eclimrc1
    osgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/workspace1
    nailgun.server.port=9091

    $ vim ~/.eclimrc2
    osgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/workspace2
    nailgun.server.port=9092

    $ eclimd -f ~/.eclimrc1
    $ eclimd -f ~/.eclimrc2

  .. note::

    The -f argument is not supported by eclipse so the above option is only
    available when using a headless eclimd instance.

3. Windows Users: Create Windows shortcuts:

   - In Windows Explorer, open your eclipse folder.
   - Hold down the right mouse button and drag the eclimd.bat file to where
     you want the shortcut to exist (like your desktop) and release the
     right mouse button.
   - Choose "Create Shortcut(s) Here"
   - Right click the shortcut and choose "Properties"
   - | On the "Shortcut" tab edit the "Target:" field and append:
     | -Dosgi.instance.area.default=\@user.home/workspace1 -Dnailgun.server.port=9091
   - Repeat this process for your other workspaces.
